  "TaskDescription": "This task is an orientation judgement relative to vertical, under condition of the tilt illusion. Participants are presented with a surround annular grating of +-30 degrees, which induces a repulsive tilt illusion on a central target grating. The angle of the central grating is titrated to the angle at which it appears vertical (recieves clockwise and counterclockwise oritentation judgements equally often). They then perform judgements on the perceptually-vertical central gratings in the presence of distractors to determine the influence of neural oscillations on the trial-by-trial fluctuations in perception.",
